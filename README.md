The goal of SSIMmap is to provide a comprehensive tools for working with Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) for map comparisons. The SSIMmap package includes four functions for calculating the similarities between maps: 1) ssim_bandwidth, ssim_constant, ssim_polygon,ssim_raster. Users who want to compare two maps and quantify the similarities can utilize this package and visualize the results using other tools(e.g., tmap and ggplot) as well.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of SSIMmap from [GitHub](https://github.com/Hailyee-Ha/SSIMmap.git) with:

```
## Usage
To use the SSIMmap package, first load it into your R environment:

``` r
library(SSIMmap)
```

## Functions
SSIMmap includes the following key functions:
1) ssim_bandwidth:
2) ssim_constant:
3) ssim_polygon:
4) ssim_raster:

## Example
